## [Deploy MarteXcoin Masternode](Deploy.md)

## [Update MarteXcoin Node/Masternode](Update.md)

## After the masternode is working you must install and configure the [Sentinel](https://github.com/martexcoin/sentinel). If you do not install sentinel, the masternode and governance will not work correctly.

### You are responsible for your masternode both in terms of maintenance and safety. We recommend monitoring your masternode at least once a day.

## To read more about Martexcore masternodes see [here](https://github.com/MarteXcoin-documentation/Documentation/tree/master/masternode).
